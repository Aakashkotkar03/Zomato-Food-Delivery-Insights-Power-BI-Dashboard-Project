Zomato Food Delivery Insights: Power BI Dashboard Project

This project focuses on building a Power BI dashboard to analyze key insights from Zomato, a leading food delivery service. The dataset includes information on users, restaurants, food menus, and orders, which were integrated and modeled in Power BI to create a comprehensive view of Zomato’s operations. The dashboard provides insights into customer demographics, restaurant performance, popular food items, and sales trends over time.

Through various visualizations and DAX measures, the dashboard enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by analyzing order volumes, customer behavior, and restaurant ratings. Key metrics such as total sales, order quantities, and user engagement are highlighted, offering a clear view of the platform’s performance.
